## Hey there,

I'm currently a masters student in the Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering at the University of Chicago. My current studies are focused on AI & Computation for Materials: I graduate from this program in 2026.

Previously, I studied chemical engineering student at Brigham Young University in Provo, UT. From September 2023 until September 2025, I worked with Dr. David Lignell (BYU Ignite), developing a flamelet-progress variable approach to more accurately capture fire and flame behavior under high stress with heat loss (including radiation). We're summarizing our results and hoping to submit the work for publication soon.
