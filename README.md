## Hey there,

I'm currently a Chemical Engineering student at Brigham Young University in Provo, UT. For the last 3 years, I've worked with Dr. David Lignell in the BYU Ignite Lab, developing a flamelet-progress variable approach for simulating fires with heat loss (the TableMaker repo). This work should be published in spring 2025.
